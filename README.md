# Git / GitHub Kickstarter

Utility script for turning a local project into a GitHub project. Required steps:

 * create a local project (i.e., initially without Git)
 * create a GitHub repository (e.g, via the web interface; don't add any content at this point)
   * note: the local project's directory name and the repository name must be identical
 * change (cd) into the project's directory
 * execute `git-kickstarter.sh` from the project's directory
